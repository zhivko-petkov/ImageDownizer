# ImageDownsizer üñºÔ∏è
University WinForm image downsize application

# Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è
C# WinForms application which down-sizes images. The app users can select an image using the standard open file dialog, enter a downscaling factor (real number), and produce a new downscaled image. WinForm includes image file upload, save, select downsize % and image box (presents processed image). 

# Architecture üî®
There are 3 services which are ConsequentialService, ConsequentialBitmapService and ParallelService which include the business logic of our functionalities. I use the needed objects for properly decoding and loading the image in its file format. After that, I used bilinear interpolation to downsize the image.
